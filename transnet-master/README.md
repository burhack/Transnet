# transnet
A service that connects all transportation infrastructures, integrated with the high-speed Transpod train system


# our goal
1) create basic android app that includes:
  - login/signup information page
  - google map integraton to calculate best path given points A and B
  
2) have a payment system working with facial recognition and a mock credit card info

3) extend our payment system to NFC (ie for rideshares), Presto (for public transit), etc... to make our service global

4) be able to have third party services on our platform such as rideshares, subways, streetcars, taxis, planes...(why not?!)
  - we can compare the prices with planes for example given the approximated cost of $70 for Toronto-Montreal

4) include a bot to alert a service worker of when a user tries to enter the station that is not authorized

5) include a hardware demo to show how doors can open in a station based on whether the user has paid or not
